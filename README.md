# contact-dictionary

Problem:
You have to make a Contacts application which supports following two operations:
Add contact
Search Contact
Contact is defined as firstName and/or lastName separated by space. Some examples of valid contacts are:
Chris Harris
Chris Cairns
Harry Potter
Chris
Add contact should take the name and add it to contact list so that it becomes searchable.
Search contact should match the contacts for a given search string.
